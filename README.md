[2024 Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) - My solutions

Eh why not

## Python
  - `python/day1part1.py`  - They're toying with us, this is just list sorting and absolute math
  - `python/day1part2.py`  - It's a simple solution that won't scale, but with only 1000 numbers in it doesn't matter
  - `python/day2part1.py`  - Shockingly mechanical. I mean completely just plow through the test conditions, bob's yer uncle
  - `python/day2part2.py`  - Spent more time fighting python's list mechanics and reference-not-copy behaviour than tackling the core problem
